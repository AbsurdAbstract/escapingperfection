  <p>My favorite form of art takes some people by surprise. It&rsquo;s not music, or painting, or sculpture, it&rsquo;s the art of games. Sometimes people ask me why, and how games can even be considered art. Ignoring the shallowness of the question, I usually answer that games are the art of laws. Music uses sound to convey thoughts, paintings uses paint, and games use rules. I actually find rules to be the most effective, and direct way to invoke thoughts or emotions in others. Which starts to make sense when you think about how strongly people react to rules and laws outside of the context in games. This can be used to make something beautiful.</p>
<p>If you want a game-based example of how this works, take an action that is generally regarded as wrong but is dismissed by the public, like littering. No matter how much someone will make excuses when confronted, or how they ignore regulations and put themselves above the simple chore of throwing trash in a bin, everyone knows that littering has a negative affect in our world. Its not a question of IF it hurts the planet, its a question of how lazy, ignorant or entitled the person is. So, how do we make someone like that aware of the issue? Have them play a game about spreading trash. The more they litter, the more points they get. Vandalism is a win condition, and if the mechanisms of playing the game are fun, the person will be forced to do things they know are wrong to continue. Then, force them to watch how their own literal actions are destroying their own world. Show the fish dying, show animals dying off, show the world choking. That feedback response is being forced into their brain. They will hate the game, but also hate themselves, because it is a representation of what their entitlement causes.</p>
<p>Sure this might not change peoples minds, especially those that are the most lazy, ignorant, and entitled. But for those on the fence, or not knowledgable of an issue, a game is a great way to raise awareness. Anyways, long story short, I met someone today, that shares my feelings on art. I think that we share some really good ideas, and might make progress on this whole &ldquo;rebuilding art&rdquo; thing. Words of advice for today is to look for people that can put what you are thinking into words, and make friends with them.</p>
