  <p>Work has caused this site to get away from me. But I think I have learned something in the weeks that I haven&rsquo;t written here. I have undervalued the storytelling ability of lyrics and song. Since I was young, I&rsquo;ve had ideas of stories I wish to wrote, some about other times, some about other planets. But what I only recently realized is that the story wasn&rsquo;t as important to me as the message I wanted to convey, and the way I wished to convey it. I believe it possible to write these messages in a way that is more relatable, and requires less time to understand. Since music is my secret trade, and I already have music published for the machine under my face, I may begin to post my lyrical explorations here. But it is 1 AM as I write this, so now it is time to sleep.</p>
