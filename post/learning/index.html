  <p>It is a goal of mine to share some nugget of progress every day. I guess todays progress is the creation of this website itself. &ldquo;Escaping Perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope you aren&rsquo;t expecting anything of high quality on this page. I will go into further detail on my intended message later, but the pursuit of high quality goes against my beliefs. This site will soon be filled with convaluded link chains, horrible drawings, strange sounds, and mind twisting stories. I place them here so that I may create without my ideas being traced back to my public image, the brand I still am afraid to taint with my wild philosophies.</p>
<p>However ironically, the level of quality will eventually increase as my threshold for what I consider &ldquo;bad ideas,&rdquo; or ugly art, inevitably raises. That is, in fact, one of several curses of progress. As one improves, or their perception becomes refined, what they once considered brilliant becomes dull.
As all once living creatures must inevitably die,
all once wonderful ideas must inevitably become dated,
all once beautiful art must become traditional or ugly.
Everything has a lifetime.
Just like this website. One day I will stop posting my thoughts here, most likely without warning, and this site will be taken down. It doesn&rsquo;t want to die, and I don&rsquo;t want it to either. But it is an idea, so it comes with an expiration date.</p>
<p>This turned out to be much more depressing than originally intended. But I assure you, these realizations are a part of a great relief in my thoughts. But I will share more about that on another day. In the mean time try to appreciate your ideas and art, no matter how far they are from your expectations. Because I&rsquo;m sure at some point, your child self would&rsquo;ve loved to have ideas as good as those.</p>
