  <p>Today is the start of my official employee vacation, though, I work from home so the difference isn&rsquo;t that noticible. I&rsquo;ve never fished before, but I started coding a fishing game to pass the time. I have less than 100 hours in Stardew Valley, but 80% of my hours spent in that game were spent in the fishing minigame. Something about simple repeatable activities with gradual rewards is especially satisfying to me. I love the collection processes, and I love seeing my efforts rewarded. So today I formed the base for the fishing part of the game. Throw the line, let out some slack, wait for a bite, and struggle while trying to reel it in. It seems fun enough I think.</p>
<p>It also turns out that I am (still) reliant on productivity and creation for happiness. Yesterday, I felt miserable. I had spent the entire day watching through AI created content taylored especially to me. While there was enjoyment, it was incredibly short lived. I guess thats why they call it an addiction. Though I don&rsquo;t entirely believe I am addicted anymore, because that would mean I would be reliant on the entertainment instead of productivity. This happiness I feel right now is much more long lasting, and though it will only stay so long as I keep creating, I have faith this is not some other addiction.</p>
<p>In addition to the game, I also created some basic software to help in my musical journey as well. Its a simple text editor, however, it searches rhymimg words as I type. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be, because its meant to be a creative idea generator. I don&rsquo;t need another intelligent program taking over my creative journey. In fact, the imperfections make me feel like it is also a step in this process.</p>
<p>My advice for today, is figure out a way to do something yourself, and people will follow you</p>
