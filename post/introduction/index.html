  <p>Its rather late tonight, but I think its a perfect time to finally introduce myself. You may call me Absurd Abstract, Absurd, A, or anything inbetween. I am not entirely sure if this website works, or where it reaches, but here I work as a asseser of technologies. If you are reading this from another planet, world, or timeline, my job is basically to edit the outputs of computational intelligence software. Computational intelligence, is essentially a synthetically created rudementary brain that we use to create for us. Software is, well, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, but you probably get the jist. I just make sure the minds built by my superiors stay in line, and think the way we want them to.</p>
<p>When I was younger, my parents used to talk to me about &lsquo;art.&rsquo; They showed me pictures, and played sounds (sometimes at the same time), that were supposed to convey a greater meaning. Apparently, at that time that&rsquo;s what art was supposed to be. A representation of a thought or idea. The concept sounded wonderful to me, even when I was too young to fully grasp what it meant. But outside of what my parents showed me, the media and entertainment that others presented as art never held meaning in quite the same way. Occasionally there were wonderful exceptions, but gradually even those exceptions went away, and people were content.</p>
<p>Eventually the demand for entertainment became so high that we turned to the computational intelligence. The media being created was so formulaic that it was easy to replicate. So before long the tools to create any form of art one could desire were free for the hands of any common person to explore. Or thats what they say at least. Hell, I did maintinence on these programs for years, and not once did I ever feel like creating something for myself. I mean why try? There was already infinite copies of anything I would want to watch, read, or listen to. Nothing I made would ever actually be special.</p>
<p>(Cont. 2/18/24)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure most people felt the same way, since I never heard of anyone around me creating their own art. I suppose there is a chance, they just never felt comfortable sharing it with me, but whenever I had the opportunity to have a conversation about creating art with a friend it always steered the same way. With so much entertainment at my fingertips, and so little energy left to devote myself, creating art is just not worth it. Why go through the struggle of learning to create when I can just relax and enjoy what is already out there.</p>
<p>Well readers, as you can probably guess, I have grown quite unhappy with this stagnancy. Though I don&rsquo;t know the path to making art the way it used to be, I cannot walk it by finding every tool available to make it easier. I also realize that I can&rsquo;t take detours by outsourcing the work to other synthetic, or even organic minds. This is why I code this site from scratch, using a coding language I didn&rsquo;t know till one week ago. This is why I continue to teach myself bit by bit the old ways of art, and share them with those that may have forgotten. It&rsquo;s because I know that the journey is a slow and arduous one, and the only way that to break the addiction to instant gratification is to make this journey with others.</p>
