  <p>Its rather late tonight, but I think its a perfect time to finally introduce myself. You may call me Absurd Abstract, Absurd, A, or anything inbetween. I am not entirely sure if this website works, or where it reaches, but here I work as a assseser of technologies. If you are reading this from another planet, world, or timeline, my job is basically to edit the outputs of computational intelligence software. Computational intelligence, is essentially a synthetically created rudementary brain that we use to create for us. Software is, well, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure. But you probably get the jist. I just make sure the minds built by my superiors stay in line, and think the way we want them to.</p>
<p>When I was younger, my parents used to talk to me about &lsquo;art.&rsquo; They showed me pictures, and played sounds (sometimes at the same time), that were supposed to convey a greater meaning. Apparently, at that time thats what art was supposed to be. A representation of a thought or idea. The concept sounded wonderful to me, even when I was too young to fully grasp what it meant. But outside of what my parents showed me, the media and entertainment that others presented as art never held meaning in quite the same way. Occasionally there were wonderfull exceptions, but gradually even those exceptions went away, and people were content.</p>
<p>Eventually the demand for entertainment became so high that we turned to the computational intelligence. The media being created was so formulaic that it was easy to replicate. So before long the tools to create any form of art one could desire were free for the hands of any common person to explore. Or thats what they say at least. Hell, I did maintinence on these programs for years, and not once did I ever feel like creating something for myself. I mean why try? There was already infinite copies of anything I would want to watch, read or listen to. Nothing I made would ever actually be special.</p>
<p>(Will finish Tomorrow, thanks for being patient -AA)</p>
