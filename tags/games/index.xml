      <description>Today is the start of my official employee vacation, though, I work from home so the difference isn&amp;rsquo;t that noticible. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fished before, but I started coding a fishing game to pass the time. I have less than 100 hours in Stardew Valley, but 80% of my hours spent in that game were spent in the fishing minigame. Something about simple repeatable activities with gradual rewards is especially satisfying to me.</description>
