      <description>Today is the start of my official employee vacation, though, I work from home so the difference isn&amp;rsquo;t that noticible. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fished before, but I started coding a fishing game to pass the time. I have less than 100 hours in Stardew Valley, but 80% of my hours spent in that game were spent in the fishing minigame. Something about simple repeatable activities with gradual rewards is especially satisfying to me.</description>

      <description>Work has caused this site to get away from me. But I think I have learned something in the weeks that I haven&amp;rsquo;t written here. I have undervalued the storytelling ability of lyrics and song. Since I was young, I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas of stories I wish to wrote, some about other times, some about other planets. But what I only recently realized is that the story wasn&amp;rsquo;t as important to me as the message I wanted to convey, and the way I wished to convey it.</description>
