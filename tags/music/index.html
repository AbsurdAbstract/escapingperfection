    Today is the start of my official employee vacation, though, I work from home so the difference isn&rsquo;t that noticible. I&rsquo;ve never fished before, but I started coding a fishing game to pass the time. I have less than 100 hours in Stardew Valley, but 80% of my hours spent in that game were spent in the fishing minigame. Something about simple repeatable activities with gradual rewards is especially satisfying to me.

    Work has caused this site to get away from me. But I think I have learned something in the weeks that I haven&rsquo;t written here. I have undervalued the storytelling ability of lyrics and song. Since I was young, I&rsquo;ve had ideas of stories I wish to wrote, some about other times, some about other planets. But what I only recently realized is that the story wasn&rsquo;t as important to me as the message I wanted to convey, and the way I wished to convey it.
